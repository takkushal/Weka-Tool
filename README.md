Data visualization using WEKA Tool

Predicting the classification of data in a suitable class is a challenging task. It depends on various factors to predict the
dependent variables. Since decision tree evaluation can be quantified and it is simple to use, so a model using decision tree
has been proposed by to predict the event like rain & sunny by inputting average temperature, humidity and pressure. Which can be used by farmers or by peoples of all walk of life in taking the intelligent decisions. This model can be used in machine learning and further the proposed model has scope for improvement as more and more relevant attributes can be used in predicting the dependent variable. Decision tree has been implemented in Weka to facilitate the forecasting of weather..
